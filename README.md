Project Overview (100 Marks)
Objective
The objective is to create a simple React calculator that uses React Hooks, specifically the useState hook.

Task
The first step is to take two inputs from the user. These inputs will represent the two numbers that will be used in the calculations. The input fields should be of type "text" and not "number."
Next, create four buttons for the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
When each button is clicked, two functions should be called. The first function will be for validation, which will check if the input fields are not empty and if the numbers entered are either integers, floating-point numbers, positive, or negative. The second function will perform the operation and set the result using the useState hook.
If the validation fails, a red error message should be displayed, as shown in the second screen of the Figma file. This error message should be handled using the useState hook as well.
If the result is shown, a green success message should be displayed along with the result, and the state of the result should be updated and shown on the screen.
Overall, the goal of the contest is to create a functional React calculator that makes use of the useState hook and properly handles input validation and displaying results.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
